## API creation and how to run  
to create a new api run the command:  
``dotnet new webapi -o api``  
'-o api' will create a folder called 'api'  

cd into the api folder and run the command to run the project:  
``dotnet watch run``  
it will run the created api and open a swagger page with the newly created template  
the 'watch' reloads the project when something is changed
